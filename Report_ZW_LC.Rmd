### **Abstract** (2.5M)
##### **Aim and Rationale**
* The aim of the experiment was to find whether the use of VR-based therapy would have a positive effect on patients who are undergoing treatment for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).
* Virtual Reality offers immersive experiences that have the ability to simulate real-world scenarios in a controlled environment. VR allows for desensitization to certain scenarios by exposing patients to situations that can trigger anxiety. 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Acrophobia and Social Anxiety Disorders can be treated through the use of VR exposure therapy (VRET). The integration of VR into therapy practices, showcases the potential it has to make positive changes to treatments for anxiety disorder.
            
##### **Participants and Setting**
* There was **180** participants in total for this study. They were **randomly sampled** from the clinic's client list. **96 were Male** and **84 were Female**. They were randomly assigned into the two groups.
* **Control (Traditional CBT, no VR) (M = 48, F = 42)**
* **Experimental (VR-Based Therapy) (M = 48, F = 42)**
* All participants were between the ago of **18-40** years old.

##### **Experiment Design**
* The two groups proceeded to go to 12 weeks of treatment with a therapist in 50 minute sessions. During the treatment sessions, the patients either experienced the traditional CBT or underwent the VR-Based therapy.

##### **Results Gathering**
* In this study, the participants were asked to self-report the severity of the anxiety they were feeling. The measurements used were the 'State-Trait Anxiety Inventory' and 'Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 Item Scale'. Both use a range of 0 - 10.

### 4 - **Introduction** (15M)
##### **Topic and Context**
* The amount of people who suffer from anxiety disorders worldwide is approximately 301 million, World Health Organisation, 2019.
* Anxiety disorders are mental disorders which can include a variety of feelings such as anxiety and fear. These feelings can cause individuals to experience a 'racing heart' and/ or 'shaky limbs'. Typically, anxiety is a response to stress but individuals who suffer from anxiety disorders tend to feel these unwanted emotions all the time. This can seriously affect their performance in physical activities, work, school or friendships.
* Triggers for these anxiety disorders can stem from wide range of factors such as medical conditions, the surrounding environment and genetics. There are many different types of anxiety disorders. These include Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorders, Panic Disorders, Separation Anxiety Disorder and Agoraphobia. There are many treatment options available for anxiety disorders including medication, behaviour therapy and psychotherapy.


##### **Rationale**
* The treatment of anxiety disorders is being transformed by Virtual Reality as it can simulate real-world scenarios in a controlled environment that can be immersive and therapeutic to individuals with anxiety disorders. VR exposure therapy allows individuals to be exposed to situations that can trigger their anxiety. Through consistent sessions the individual can be desensitized to these triggers which can allow traditional cognitive-behavioural therapy. The integration of Virtual Reality into therapeutic practices shows that it has the potential to positively change the treatments for anxiety disorders.
